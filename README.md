# Alarm Manager ANE
Alarm manager ANE is a very simple to use extension library which lets you set a time using the Date API in AS3 and setup a task to be executed as soon as the alarm goes off! this alarm manager extension is configured wisely enough so that even if the user reboots his/her device, the extension will be notified and will make sure that the task will run as expected!

**NOTICE: the demo ANE works only after you hit the "OK" button in the dialog which opens. in your tests make sure that you are NOT calling other ANE methods prior to hitting the "OK" button.**

# AS3 API:
```actionscript

```

For the ANE to work as expected, make sure you are adding the required services and permissions to your .xml manifest file. below are the necessary changes to the manifest.
